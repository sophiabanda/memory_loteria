 DEFINE REQUIRED CONSTANTS:
Card options


DEFINE STATE VARIABLES:
Player selection
Define the initial “board” with 12 individual 
card backs (they should be positioned at random)
Game timer (2min) or countdown
Initial amount of guesses allotted (5?)

CACHED ELEMENTS:
Start button
Reset button - you can use the restart button any time
Welcome header

ACTIONS:
Render board: All cards face down.
"Press start to start.."

Once the start button is pressed, all 12 cards 
flip over for 1.5 seconds to give you a chance to memorize

A player selects a card
The card briefly flips over (2 seconds?), then back over
The player selects another card

    If it’s a match, the card remains upright with image showing
        If it’s not a match, a point is subtracted from available guesses

    If player runs out of guesses
        If player runs out of time
            Some womp womp event happens

If player wins
    Some celebratory event happens

STRETCH GOALS:
Card animation; maybe cards rotate at win/loss, etc
Surprise if you win with a certain card
Add cursor image of either Valentina or Cholula sauce
