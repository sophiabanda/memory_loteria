# Welcome to Memory Loter√≠a! üéâ

### **Description:**

This browser game of Concentration is inspired by a game from my childhood,
Mexican Loter√≠a. I created this game with a data-centric approach, and while it has not reached its full
optimisation, in its current state it is easily scalable and able to be updated with more images and functions.

### **How to play:**

Once the page has loaded, the game can begin! Start by clicking on one card, then another.
If they are a match, they will remain upright so that you can select another two cards. If they do not match,
they will quickly flip back over, and you will need to do your best to remember the cards locations in order
to create more matches. For each incorrect match you lose one point. If you achieve all available matches, you win!
